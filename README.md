# INTERNSHIP-EXPERIENCE-UK-BY-BRIGHT-NETWORK-2021-GOOGLE-CODING-CHALLENGE-
I implemented  various components of a command-line application simulating YouTube. The result of my code will be a fully working command-line application, simulating how a user would interact with YouTube in real life but without any of the web elements.
